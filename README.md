# Data Structure Visualizer

**Data Structure Visualizer** is a project designed to visually demonstrate how data structures and algorithms work. The project aims to illustrate the operations of various data structures and algorithms.

## Data Structures Included in the Project
The project currently includes the following data structures:
- **Queue**
- **Stack**
- **Linked List**
- **Graph**
- **BFS** (Breadth-First Search algorithm)

### BFS
Currently, the **BFS** algorithm is the only implemented algorithm in the project. Users can select a starting node for the search, and then see which nodes will be visited during the execution of the algorithm.

## Features
- **Add and remove** values from the data structures.
- **Run the BFS algorithm** and see which nodes will be visited.
- **Visual representation** of the data structures and the BFS algorithm.
- An easy-to-use interface that allows for adding and removing nodes.

## Technologies
- **Frontend**: React.js (for building the interactive user interface).
- **Backend**: Python with Flask (serving requests and handling logic).
- **Visualization**: Graphical representations of data structures and algorithms.
- **CSS**: Custom CSS for styling the user interface and enhancing the visual appeal of the data structures and algorithms.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone or Download** the repository.
2. Install the dependencies for both the frontend and backend:
    - For the frontend, run `npm install` inside the frontend directory.
    - For the backend (Flask), run `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside the backend directory.
  
3. **Start the Server**:
    - Run the backend server using `python app.py` in the backend directory.
  
4. **Start the Frontend**:
    - Run the frontend locally using `npm start` in the frontend directory.

5. The application will now be accessible in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Functionality

1. Users can **add and remove** values from the data structures.
2. Users can **run the BFS algorithm** on a graph and see which nodes are visited.
3. All operations are visually represented in real-time, with updates to the data structures displayed as they are modified.

## Ideas for Future Improvements

- Add **more algorithms** such as DFS (Depth-First Search), Dijkstra's Algorithm, and more*.
- Improve the **BFS visualization** to show step-by-step execution, illustrating the algorithm's progress.
- Add support for additional data structures like **binary trees** and **AVL trees**.

## About

This project is designed to visually demonstrate how data structures and algorithms work. It aims to improve understanding of their operations by showing the real-time changes as they occur. There is potential for expanding the project with more algorithms and data structures in the future.
